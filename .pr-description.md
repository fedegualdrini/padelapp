## Overview

This PR sets up GA4 analytics infrastructure and verifies the Share Match analytics implementation from PR #49.

## Changes

### Infrastructure
- Add AnalyticsProvider component to initialize GA4 on app load
- Integrate analytics initialization into root layout
- Add .env.example with GA4 measurement ID configuration

### Documentation
- Create comprehensive GA4 setup guide: docs/growth/analytics-setup.md
- Create verification summary: docs/growth/analytics-verification-summary.md
- Add analytics testing script: scripts/test-analytics-events.sh

### Verification
- Reviewed PR #49 Share Match analytics implementation
- Verified match_share_generated event fires correctly
- Verified match_share_viewed event fires correctly
- Confirmed event parameters include match_id and group_slug

## Event Types Implemented

Share Match Events:
- match_share_generated: When user generates a share link
- match_share_viewed: When shared match link is viewed

Other Events (Ready for Future Features):
- ranking_share_generated, ranking_share_viewed
- match_created, player_registered

## Setup Instructions

1. Get GA4 Measurement ID from https://analytics.google.com
2. Add to environment: NEXT_PUBLIC_GA4_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX
3. Events will be sent to GA4 in production
4. Console-only mode in development (without measurement ID)

## Testing

Run the analytics test script:
./scripts/test-analytics-events.sh

Or manually test:
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Click Share Match button → Look for console log with match_share_generated
3. Open share link → Look for console log with match_share_viewed

## Sprint 3 Readiness

Analytics infrastructure ready for Sprint 3 growth features:
- Group invitations (invite_generated, invite_accepted)
- Prediction league (prediction_made, prediction_result)
- Social features (comment_posted, like_given)

## Next Steps

- Configure GA4 measurement ID for production
- Set up GA4 dashboard for key metrics
- Test events in production with DebugView
